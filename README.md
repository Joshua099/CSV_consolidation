# CSV_consolidation
Python Script automating the consolidation of CSV files, with some extra feature functions

I was tasked with combining 100s of csv files during my time as a Data Analyst Assistant at WorldOil. I coded some additional aggregating functions that completed some tasks that my manager requested. 

For example, the original filenames of the csvs that were being consolidated were requested to be kept so that they can backtrack information if necessary. I added the original_filename_col function to do just that. 

The consolidate.py file was basically a scratch file to make sure what i was doing was working. Once i knew my code worked, I refactored it all into separate functions in consolidation_functions.py

# insert_blank_row
Had to manually insert thousands of blank rows for a report format a manager requested. Quick script that did it for me.
